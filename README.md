# Senior_Design_2022_SW_Mini_Project

For our project, as both Prithika and Yihe are new to app devlopment, apis, and firebase, we decided that we would follow the recommended approach
of implementing the application through React Native. This would provide a sufficient challenge for ourselves, as well as possible guidance as we
grapple with this process for the first time. Prithika primarily worked on creating the UI, walking through the Hello World tutorials, learning 
about React Native and Andriod studios. She created a very basic UI that can take in a twitter handle as text. Yihe worked on the backend, using 
python to....

Unfortunately, connecting the front and backends proved to be difficult as we were unable to generate the SHA1 codes for the google authentification
and firebase. We continuely got an error stating that the keystore was missing, desite the fact that the file did exist in the appropriate spot (see 
images folder). We tried generating the keys through the terminal, through andriod studios, and by following various tutorials. Prithika even 
attempted starting over and creating another app to see if there was a set up error, but ran into the same issues. Yihe then tried implemeting it from
his enviroment to see if t was possibly an enviroment mistake, but unfortunately ran into more errors.

Overall, this was a very thorough challenge and learning experience for both of us. We learned how to set up google fire base (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/twitterchecker-5cb4d/overview)
and learned to implment the twitter api locally. We however struggled with cross-platform front-backend integration.

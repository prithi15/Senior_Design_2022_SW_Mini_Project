Meeting 2: 9/12


Meeting 1: 9/9
Discussed our familirity with apps. Both are pretty new to it. Decided that the best course 
of action would be to follow hints from lecture and familiarize ourselves with the process.
Prithika took path 1 of looking into React Native. Yihe took path 2 of looking into Twitter.
Decided to share updates at next meeting on 9/12 at 10am.
